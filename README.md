# simple-android-colour-guessing-game-Android-Studio

********************************************my plan for this game 
This is very simple interactive UI based application similar concept like game. Here this application is designed to understand the color combination of rainbow. Here user need to remember the wavelength of the color light  like indigo color wavelength is 440-450 so . In this application a list of colors name will be provided in form of clickable buttons and you need to click on the correct color name buttons respective to wavelength and on correct click you will be taken to the new screen for next question to be answered and similarly you need to click seven correct color name against it's wavelength and in case of wrong click you need to start from beginning again and when you reach to final you can play song to celebrate your win and you can see rainbow as WebView image.  When you loose you can get hind in pop up message which will help you to win this game. The main purpose of this game type application is to understand and implements the concept which I have learned with in this course
